# Quizzical

Quizzical is a collection of Rust crates designed to simplify the process of creating and managing quizzes. It provides a library for building quiz software and a command-line tool for creating quizzes easily.

This repository contains 2 crates:
- quizzical: a library for creating quiz software
- quizzical-cli: a command-line tool for making quizzes.

# Note on Licensing

Although both crates are licensed under `GPL-v3-or-later`, we support exceptions to the copyleft nature of the license or even dual licensing.

## Pricing

- **GPL Linking Exception**: If you need to use a non-GPL-compatible license for a program using the quizzical library, the price is £9.99 per linked software.

- **Dual Licensing**: If you wish to purchase quizzical (both CLI and library) under a more permissive license like Apache-2.0, you can do so for £25. If you would like to license it under an even more permissive license, such as MIT (no attribution) or CC0 (essentially public domain), the price will be negotiated based on your use case but will be less than £100.
